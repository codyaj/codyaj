# Hi, I'm Cody

I'm a Software Engineering (Honours) student with a specialisation in embedded systems, low-level security, and firmware engineering. I'm passionate about hardware hacking, vulnerability research, and building secure, high performance systems.

### Current Work

* **Firmware Engineer Student:** Developing secure Zephyr RTOS application in C and performing hardware security analysis using SCA and Fault Injection.
* [**Field Intelligence Collector:**](https://github.com/codyaj/FieldIntelligenceCollector) An all in one tool for security researchers to identify IoT devices through network pattern analysis.
* [**Router Vulnerability Analysis:**](https://github.com/codyaj/tplink-ac1200-wap-v2-security-analysis) A full hardware to firmware teardown of a TP-Link router, resulting in root shell access and discovery of hardcoded private keys.
